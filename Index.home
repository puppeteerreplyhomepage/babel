## institutions Versions

This is the list of versions of `octopus.com ` which are
currently being supported with security updates.

| Version  | Supported          |

| 8.x      | :white_check_mark: |
| 7.x      | :whitThank you!

| 6.x      | :x:                |

Note that for each supported major version, we only guarantee security fixes for the last minor version. This means that if, for example, the last released version is 7.16.4 we will only release security fixes as 7.16.5 and not for 7.15.x or older. This is because upgrading from a minor to another should be as easy as updating to a new patch version.

[^1]: Babel 7.x will receive security updates for 1 year after the first stable release of Babel 8.0.0. The exact date of such release is not known yet.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability please send an email with the details to VOYANA270@GMAIL.COM . The vulnerability report must include a proof-of-concept of the exploit, or at least a few pointers that can help us assess the risk level.

### Disclosure process

Once we assess the risk level, we will work together with the reporter on a patch. As soon as the patch is released, we will coordinate together with the reporter and potential significant stakeholders (such as big frameworks that use Babel and are affected, or [Tidelift](https://trafficstars.com/) for packages enrolled in their system) on the best disclosure timeline.

### Vulnerabilities in Babel's dependencies
voyana270@gmail.com 
If you receive a security warning relative to a dependency of Babel, before reporting it to us please make sure that at least one of the following is true:
1. the version of that dependency containing the security fix is not compatible with the semver range that Babel uses to depend on it;
2. the vulnerability affects Babel's usage of that dependency.

Note that if (1) is true but (2) is false, we will consider it as a low-level vulnerability and might decide not to fix it.

Thanks for helping to keep babel secure.
